# Lab 1: Introduction to Packet Tracer, Peer-to-Peer Communication, Study of Cables and Its Color Codes

## Objective
- Introduce Packet Tracer and its basic features.
- Understand peer-to-peer communication.
- Study different types of network cables and their color codes.

## Materials Required
- Packet Tracer software
- Network cables (Ethernet, crossover, etc.)

## Theory
### Overview of Packet Tracer
Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool that allows users to design, configure, and troubleshoot networks.

### Basics of Peer-to-Peer Communication
A peer-to-peer (P2P) network allows devices to communicate directly without relying on a central server.

### Color Coding Standards for Network Cables
Network cables follow specific standards (T568A and T568B) that define the order of the colored wires.

## Procedure
1. **Open Packet Tracer**: Familiarize with the interface.
2. **Create a Simple Network**:
   - Add two computers and one switch.
   - Connect the computers using Ethernet cables.
3. **Configure IP Addresses**:
   - Assign IP addresses (e.g., Computer A: 192.168.1.1, Computer B: 192.168.1.2).
4. **Test the Connection**:
   - Use the `ping` command to test connectivity.
5. **Study Network Cables**: 
   - Document different cable types and their color codes.

## Observations
- **IP Configuration Steps**:
  - Computer A: 192.168.1.1
  - Computer B: 192.168.1.2
- **Ping Results**:
  - Successful connection from Computer A to Computer B.
- **Color Codes for Cables**:
  - **T568A**:
    - Pin 1: White/Green
    - Pin 2: Green
    - Pin 3: White/Orange
    - Pin 4: Blue
    - Pin 5: White/Blue
    - Pin 6: Orange
    - Pin 7: White/Brown
    - Pin 8: Brown
  - **T568B**:
    - Pin 1: White/Orange
    - Pin 2: Orange
    - Pin 3: White/Green
    - Pin 4: Blue
    - Pin 5: White/Blue
    - Pin 6: Green
    - Pin 7: White/Brown
    - Pin 8: Brown

## Conclusion
Understanding basic networking concepts is crucial for designing and troubleshooting networks. Packet Tracer is an excellent tool for learning these concepts in a practical environment.
